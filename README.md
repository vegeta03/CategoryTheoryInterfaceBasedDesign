# Category Theory, The Essence of Interface Design

## Abstract Nonsense
(Very) roughly speaking, category theory is the study of the general form of mathematical theories,
without regard to their content. As a result, a proof that relies on category theoretic ideas often 
seems slightly out of context to those who are not used to such abstraction, sometimes to the extent 
that it resembles a comical non sequitur. Such proofs are sometimes dubbed "abstract nonsense" as a 
light-hearted way of alerting people to their abstract nature.
